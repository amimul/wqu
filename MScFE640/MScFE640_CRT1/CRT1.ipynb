    "Mclean Technology is a software engineering company. The Board of Directors has established a policy of paying out 30% of net income as dividends. In the financial year recently ended, Mclean earned a return on equity (ROE) of 18%. Beginning shareholders' equity was $10,500,500. A dividend was paid to shareholders. Mclean has 100,000 shares outstanding.\n",

    "Jason Rissik is investigating Mclean with the intention of purchasing shares, if they are reasonably priced. He decides that he will purchase shares in Mclean if his estimate of intrinsic value is 20% or higher than the current market price. The current market price is 107.02. Rissik decides to use the Gordon Growth Model with dividends as the cash flow input. To estimate $g$ he decides to use the formula:\n",
